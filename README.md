After unzipping you will see the following project structure

etc...

Now in the RStudio enter the following at the prompt

> source("c:\\Rex\\projectfiles\\run_analysis.R")
> x<-getData("c:\\Rex\\projectfiles")

You should see a file create in your folder as "AllMeansData.txt".

Please note , inside the code, I have added n=20 in read.fwf command. This is basically to read just first 20 lines of each file .
If you have enough memory in your system, you can remove thos entry frm the code and run. You should see the entire 
output file.
